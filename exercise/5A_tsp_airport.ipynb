    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The travelling salesman problem is a classic geographic problem that may be framed as \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a class of problems known as *'np-hard'*, that is the problem size grows non-linearly with the number of points to visit, and soon becomes too computationally expensive to compute **all** possibilities. There is also no algorithm known that efficiently gives a certain optimum solution. The table below illustrates the speed with which the number of possible routes increases as the number of points to visit grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Points | No. Possible Routes        |\n",
    "|--------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| 5      | 120                        |\n",
    "| 10     | 3,628,800                  |\n",
    "| 20     | 2,432,902,008,176,640,000  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Np-hard problems are ‘solved’ by using a *‘heuristic algorithm’*. Heuristic algorithms follow a method designed to efficiently give a sufficiently good solution at the expense of not guaranteeing that an optimal solution is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the travelling salesman problem there are many heuristics described. It is a favourite problem of algorithm writers!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we will use a ‘hill-climbing’ method based on reversing portions of the route (or a ‘pairwise exchange’ approach). Hill-climbing methods perform some search that then leads to them picking the best improvement in that step of the search. The search method is then repeated until no further improvement is found. Hill-climbing methods may get trapped in local optima in complicated problems – the solution found depends on the starting point. To reduce the impact of this the algorithm is repeated multiple times with different start points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to be Performed\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm will follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1.** Pick a route at random (randomly order points to visit).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2.** Examine all possible pairwise exchanges in the route in (e.g. if we have a route A-B-<span style=\"color:blue\">**C**</span>-D-E-<span style=\"color:blue\">**F**</span>-G-H, and pairwise exchange **C** and **F** we have a new route A-B-<span style=\"color:red\">**F**</span>-E-D-<span style=\"color:red\">**C**</span>-G-H). Choose the pairwise exchange that gives the best reduction in route distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3.** Repeat **Step 2.** until no further improvement is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4.** Repeat from **Step 1** for a determined number of repeats (or repeat until a maximum algorithm use time is reached).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run an algorithm like this we need to know the travel times or distances between points. In the example below we calculate a straight line (or ‘[Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)’) distance based on x and y locations. x/y locations are readily available for addresses (such as Eastings and Northings in the UK, or Lat/ Longs). Straight line distances or travel times, while only approximate may be good enough to get reasonable solutions. More precise solutions could use travel times or distances determined from Geographical Information Systems. You can watch a video using one such application, Routino on [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (WSL) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-RgaPDnjvI)."
